# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m a Software Engineer with hands-on experience building backend services, cloud systems, and data-driven applications. I work mostly with Java, Python, Spring Boot, and AWS, and I enjoy solving practical engineering problems that improve performance, reliability, and scalability.

I’ve built and deployed microservices, integrated third-party APIs, optimized databases, and improved system throughput through clean engineering and testing practices. I’ve also explored machine learning through my MSc research on GAN-based synthetic data generation.

I like working in teams where code quality, clear communication, and ownership matter. I’m open to backend, cloud, and platform engineering roles where I can contribute and continue learning.
